# check-triangle

Mala is studying G-VII. Her class teacher asked her to identify the type of triangle.

But she doesnâ€™t know the concept of triangle types. Can you help her to identify the triangle

types based on the values of sides given to mala.

Hint:

a. If all the sides are equal then it is an Equilateral Triangle

b. If two sides are equal then it is a Isosceles Triangle

c. If no sides are equal then it is a Scalene Triangle
